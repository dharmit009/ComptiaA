# Mobile Device Connectivity

## Wireless and Cellular Data Networks

**Early Cellular Network:**
* Cellular Networks = "Cell Sites"
* Each cell maintained different frequencies.
* 1G and 2G were the first early networks.
* CDMA & GSM.
* Great for voice but poor data / circuit switched.
* Upgrades made to allow data but still not robust.

## 2G / 3G / 4G / 5G

**1G:** Analog Service which was not designed to carry or transfer data.
**2G:** Circuit Switched Networks.
**3G:** Circuit Switched Networks.
   * Introduced in 1998, deployed in 2000.
   * Speeds up to 3Mbits/s, some up to 7Mbits/s
   * Introduced GPS, Mobile Maps, video on demand, video conferencing.
   * Improved existing Call quality and connectivity.
**4G / LTE:** Packet Switched Networks.
   * Long Term Evolution - convergence of several technologies.
   * CDMA & GSM evolution.
   * Providers could send voice and data across one network.
   * Based on EDGE - upto 150 Mbits/s (throughput)
   * LTE Advanced - LTE-A upto 300 Mbits/s (throughput)
**5G:** Packet Switched Networks.
   * Fifth generation cellular networking
   * First Deployed in 2018 / 2019
   * Speeds between 100 - 900 Mbits/s
   * Designed for speeds up to 20 Gbits/s
   * More capabilities for markets.
   * Lower Latency while using lower power.
   * Security is much more improved.

## GSM vs CDMA Networks

**Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM):**
1. GSM was an early starter in cellular networks.
1. GSM had the biggest market share approximately 90%.
1. GSM is an European Standard.
1. Uses Subscriber Identity Module cards (SIM).
1. Efficient voice and data management.
1. T-Mobile & AT&T are the biggest US Carriers.

**Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA):**
1. Multiple users accessing the system.
1. Unique Code used.
1. Not adopted worldwide.
1. Verizon & Sprint are the biggest US carriers.

## Preferred Roaming List (PRL) updates

* CDMA Networks (Sprint & Verizon)
* Allows your phone to connect to any tower
   * Can be updated over the air (OTA) updates.
   * More capabilities for markets.

## Hotspots

* Mobile Device becomes an Internet Source.
* Connection shared with devices close by.
* Not all providers enable this service.
* Check data rates and additional charges.
