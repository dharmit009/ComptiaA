# Laptop Displays

## Types of Display:

**Liquid Crystal Display (LCD):**
It is flat panel that uses light modulating properties of liquid crystals
combined with polarizers. So the light is shown or projected through this
liquid crystal which is used to produces images in color or monochrome.

**Components of LCD:**
1. Panel
1. Backlight
1. Inverter

**Advantages Of LCD:**
1. Relatively Inexpensive.
1. Lightweight.

**Some Variations in LCD:**
1. Twisted Nematic Display (TN): Offers faster rendering but the colors are very adequate.
1. In Plane Switching Display (IPS): Beautiful Color Representation but expensive.
1. Vertical Alignment Display (VA): Falls in between TN and IPS.


## Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED)

1. Organic Compounds between the glass layers that light up when given an
   electrical charge.
1. No backlight is required. 
1. Thinner and lighter.
1. Used in tablets, smartphones, and VR headsets.
1. More expensive than LCD's.
1. You get to experience the pure black as LED's can turn off completely.

### Mobile Display Components: Backlight

**1. Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamps (CCFL):**
* Older Technology, Bigger
* Higher Power Consumption.

**2. Light-Emitting Diode (LED):**
* Newer Technology
* Thinner
* Two Types of LED: Edge or Direct Lit.

## WIFI Antenna Connector

1. Wireless antennas are ran along the display as the laptop screen has the
   highest point which would result in highest reception of network.
1. Both the antennas for Wifi 802.11 & Bluetooth can found around the display.
1. Take extra care while replacing these cables as they are very delicate.

## Camera / Webcam and Microphone

1. Built in cameras in most laptop.
1. Relatively good performance.
1. External Webcam's are better quality.
1. Take care replacing these cables.
1. They do have builtin microphones.


## Inverter

The Inverters in LCD panel are used to convert DC power into AC power which is
used to illuminate the backlight of the display.

1. Used in older laptops.
1. Converts DC power to AC.
1. Displays with inverter are a little bit bigger and chunkier.
1. They consume more power.

> **NOTE:** Troubleshooting Tips
> 1. If the LCD goes dark but you can still see the image then it likely the
>    inverter or the backlight has been damaged. In this case, you will need to
>    entirely replace the panel.
> 1. If your LCD makes a distinct *hissing* noise, that an inverter about to fail
>    and you need to replace that.
> 1. Another important thing to keep in mind, The inverter works with large
>    voltages and it has the ability to retain some electrical power. So don't
>    touch it without proper safety equipment. Make sure you are well grounded.
> 1. They get very hot as well.

## Digitizer and Touchscreen

**Digitizer:**
1. Digitizer inputs directly on the screen from a stylus.
1. It is used on laptops and tablets.
1. Receives input from a special device.

**Touchscreen:**
1. Touchscreens use digitizers in order to convert our finger as input.
1. Touchscreens are available in many devices.
1. Digitizer responds to touch.
1. It has many use in it's application.
