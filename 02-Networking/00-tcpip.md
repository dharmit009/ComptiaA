# TCP / IP

TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol.
IP stands for Internet Protocol.

TCP / IP network are a critical foundation of our networks today
* TCP / IP is about moving data from one place to another.
* TCP / IP is actually two protocols:
    * TCP: Transmission Control Protocol - Responsible for packaging data -
    Frames into packets.
    * IP : Internet Protocol - responsible for addressing

## Internet Protocol (IP):

Moving data from one location to another is similar to mailing a package from
one location to another.

* Sending a large amount of data, use a shipping box to put things into it.
* The network we are sending across is the postal carrier's shipping route.
* The mail truck is Internet Protocol (IP).
* The box or packet holds your data you are sending.
    * TCP or UDP - the type of data.
